# Practice Git Node App

Simple static Node server that serves a Hello World page with five colorful cards and a footer showing developer credit, location (with geolocation permission), and live date/time.

## Structure
- `index.html` – main page with hero, five cards, and footer
- `src/styles.css` – styling for layout and cards
- `src/scripts.js` – footer clock and geolocation helper
- `server.js` – minimal static file server
- `package.json` – scripts and nodemon setup

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm start       # start server on http://localhost:3000
# or for auto-reload
npm run dev
```

Start editing `index.html` or `src/styles.css` to practice git changes and commits.
